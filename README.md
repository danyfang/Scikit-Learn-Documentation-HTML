# Scikit-Learn-Documentation-HTML
I personally like html documentation other than pdf format.
So I built this html documentation for sklearn using sphinx.
If you want to give it a try yourself, follow the link below:
http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/1.5/tutorial.html
If specific Sphinx version is required, and the folder contains
a requirement.txt file, just run
pip install -r requirement.txt
